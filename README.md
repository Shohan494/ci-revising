# ci-revising
with codeigniter once again, notes for the updated version

- In the application/config/config.php file with a text editor and set your base URL.
- If you intend to use encryption or sessions, set your encryption key.
- If you intend to use a database, open the application/config/database.php file with a text editor and set your database settings.

#### If you wish to increase security by hiding the location of your CodeIgniter files you can rename the system and application folders to something more private. If you do rename them, you must open your main index.php file and set the $system_path and $application_folder variables at the top of the file with the new name youâ€™ve chosen.
